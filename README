Welcome to FusionPBX

You have already untared the Fusion_install.tgz file (or you would not be reading this.)

INSTALL:

Start by installing vim and python3
Vim will make editing files easier.
Python3 is required for the install scripts.

type apt-get install vim python3

Now you may enter ./install.py
Follow the prompts.
An install from packages will take aprox 10 min on a reasonably fast system.
An install from source will take aprox 45 min on the same quality of system.

As the install finishes up you have some work to do via the web interface.
A link will be shown, you may right click this to open it in a browser.
If the right click does not work copy and paste the URL into your browser.
Note: you will need to accept an exception for the SSL Certificate.
This is ok to do. You may put a public verified Certificate later.

The choice between packages and source is yours, they both install the same system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

We recommend:
OS			Debian 8
Web server		nginx
Data Base Server	Postgresql 9.4
Freeswitch		Packages
